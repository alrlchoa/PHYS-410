PDF for answers and write-up can be found in the docs folder:

Relevant Code will be found in the code folder:
- q1.py: Contains code for sequence generation. I use the Decimal datatpye for added precision rather than floats.
- q2.py: Contains code for finding the property of the system of equations. I also used the numpy.linalg library to find condition numbers.
